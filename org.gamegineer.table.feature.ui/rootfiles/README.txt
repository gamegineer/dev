OVERVIEW

Gamegineer provides a virtual tabletop for playing traditional board and card games over the Internet.  The foundation of Gamegineer is the Equinox OSGi core framework, which provides other developers with opportunities to extend the Gamegineer tabletop to support new games and features not originally envisioned.

The current release implements a basic card table.  Future releases will add support for a generic table that can be used for various purposes.

This offering is based on technology from the Eclipse project <http://www.eclipse.org>.
