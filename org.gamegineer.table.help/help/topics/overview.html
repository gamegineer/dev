		<h1>Gamegineer overview</h1>
		<p>
			Gamegineer provides a virtual tabletop for playing traditional board and card games over the Internet. The foundation of Gamegineer is the Equinox OSGi core framework, which provides other developers with opportunities to extend the Gamegineer tabletop to support new games and features not originally envisioned.
		</p>
		<h2>General usage</h2>
		<p>
			All commands are available from the main menu at the top of the screen.  Context-sensitive commands are available from a popup menu that is activated using the appropriate keyboard and/or mouse trigger of your operating system (e.g. right-clicking the mouse on Windows).
		</p>
		<p>
			The table consists of a collection of card piles.  Use the <b>Add Card Pile</b> and <b>Remove Card Pile</b> commands to add/remove card piles to/from the table, respectively.  Alternatively, the <b>Remove All Card Piles</b> command can be used to clear the entire table.  A card pile can be given the input focus by left-clicking it with the mouse.  A green border will appear around the pile to indicate it has the input focus.  Most commands will be executed in the context of the focused card pile.  Card piles can be moved by holding down the CONTROL key while left-clicking and dragging a card pile with the mouse.  The entire table can be moved by left-clicking and dragging anywhere on the green surface.  The <b>Reset Table Origin</b> command will reset the table origin to the window origin.
		</p>
		<p>
			A card pile consists of a collection of cards.  Use the <b>Add Card</b> and <b>Remove Card</b> commands to add/remove cards to/from a card pile, respectively.  Alternatively, the <b>Add Deck</b> command can be used to add an entire deck of cards to a card pile at once.  The <b>Flip Card</b> command will toggle the orientation (face up or face down) of the card at the top of the card pile.  The <b>Layout</b> command will change the arrangement of the cards in the card pile.  All of these commands are executed in the context of the focused card pile.  Cards can be moved from one card pile to another by left-clicking and dragging a card with the mouse.  When the <b>Stacked</b> layout is active, only the top card can be selected and moved.  When any of the <b>Accordian</b> layouts are active, left-clicking and dragging a card will move the selected card and all cards above it as a single unit.
		</p>
		<p>
			A new empty table can be created using the <b>New</b> command.  A table can be saved for later use using the <b>Save</b> and <b>Save As</b> commands.  A previously saved table can be loaded using the <b>Open</b> command or by selecting a previously-loaded file from the <b>Most Recently Used</b> file list.
		</p>
		<h2>Network usage</h2>
		<p>
			Use the <b>Host</b> command to host a table on the network.  Enter the name of the local network interface card and the TCP port on which to listen for connections.  Specify the name by which you wish to be known to the other players connected to the table.  You may optionally require each remote player that connects to your table to provide a password.
		</p>
		<p>
			Use the <b>Join</b> command to join a hosted table on the network.  Enter the name and TCP port of the host.  Specify the name by which you wish to be known to the other players connected to the table.  Enter the password required by the host to join the table or leave it blank if no password is required.
		</p>
		<p>
			A single player can control the network table at one time.  This player is known as the editor and has a red flag next to their name in the player list.  To request control of the table from the current editor, use the <b>Request Control</b> command.  Any player who has requested control will have a gray flag next to their name in the player list.  To cancel a previous request for control, use the <b>Cancel Control Request</b> command.
		</p>
		<p>
			The editor may transfer control to any other player in the network.  Use the <b>Give Control</b> command to select a player to which control will be given.  After executing the command, the new player will become the editor.
